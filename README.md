## üìù Project Overview

Lately, I‚Äôve been trying to get a grip on my money. Every month I‚Äôd find myself asking: "Where is all my money going?" and "Which month did I save the most?". To get clarity, I decided to use my new Excel skills to build a solution.

This project is a comprehensive personal finance dashboard built entirely in Microsoft Excel. It transforms raw, messy bank statements into a clear, interactive, and insightful visual summary of spending and saving habits.
